# dotfiles

This is a repo containing all my configurations.

It also includes a script that sets up a new MacOS computer just the way I like it.

Usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/sonicxml/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x osx_setup_sh.sh
./osx_setup_sh.sh
```
Then follow the prompts and soon you should have a computer with sensible installations :).
